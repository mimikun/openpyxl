[openpyxl original repository](https://foss.heptapod.net/openpyxl/openpyxl)

This repository is mimikun's fork.

## Why fork?

openpyxl now outputs a deprecation warning and there is no hope of a solution.

Mercurial is a software that is not used much, and its operating feel is very different from git.

The global defact standard is git.

However, Mercurial is much better than writing a version number at the end of the filename.
